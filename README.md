## TODO

- Add chime sound when activating
- Add chime sound when deactivating
- Improve monitor selection process
- Add system tray icon with context menu actions
  - Quit
  - Radio selection, entry for each monitor
- Add global hotkey for activation
- Add global hotkey for deactivation
- Add UX for hotkey
- Add launch mode that clears clipping and exits, because the app can crash with it set lol
  - Maybe make it clear upon launch, boolean config
